        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p id = "AboutMe"> I am an aspiring programmer. I was interested in the aspects of programming and how the inner workings of it worked.
            I got pulled into the programming world by seeing all the crazy things you can create and how you can potentially use it to make other
            people's lives easier. I started out with videogames and wondered how developers were able to manipulate things inside their game and implement
            features that made my gaming experience more enjoyable. I started off by learning Java and the fundamentals of Computer Science. As I kept learning 
            more about coding, I was intrigued by how everything works on a deeper level which makes me wonder how certain things are built by using these fundamentals.
